% This file parses UnicodeData.txt, provided by the Unicode Consortium,
% and when used with a Unicode-capable engine sets the following TeX
% properties:
% - \catcode 11 for all letters (Unicode class "L")
% - \catcode 11 for all combining marks (Unicode class "M")
% - \sfcode 999 for all code points of class Lu (upper case letters)
% - \lccode for all of class Ll (upper case letters) to the code point
%   itself, and \luccode to the upper case mapping (or if not given
%   to the code point itself)
% - \uccode for all of class Lu (upper case letters) to the code point
%   itself, and \lccode to the lower case mapping (or if not given
%   to the code point itself)
% - \lccode and \uccode for all of class Lt (title case letters) to the
%    lower can upper case mappings (or if not given to the code point itself)
% - \lccode and \uccode for all other letter code points are set to
%   the code point itself
% - \lccode and/or \uccode for non-letter code points for which an upper
%   or lower case mapping is given
%

% The data can only be loaded by Unicode engines. Currently this is limited to
% XeTeX and LuaTeX, both of which define \Umathcode (though that is not used in
% this file).

% This file can be loaded in IniTeX mode so the category codes of |{|, |}| and

% The first stage of parsing is dealing with the fact aht there are lots of
% data items separated by |;|. Of those, only a few are needed so they are
% picked out and everything else is dropped. There is one complication: there
% are a few cases in the data file of ranges which are marked by the descriptor
% |First| and a matching |Last|. A separate routine is used to handle these
% cases.

% At this stage we have a `normal' data line with four pieces of information:
% the code point, the Unicode class and the (possibly empty) upper and lower
% case mappings. A few utility macros are defined, then we branch based on the
% Unicode class. Notice that for all letter-like code points we first set the
% |\lccode| and |\uccode| values to the code point itself then test for the
% classes where a different setting might be appropriate. For non-letters
% there is a check to see if any mappings are available.
