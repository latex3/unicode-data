The Unicode Consortium provide a range of data files detailing
the nature of code points in Unicode. These data files are
machine-readable but large. Here, a set of loaders are provided
to parse these files during a TeX run and set appropriate
parameters in an automated fashion.

File: `load-unicode-data.tex`
=============================

The loader parses a number of data files provided by the Unicode
Consortium and when used with used Unicode-capable engine sets
up a range of TeX-related parameters based on the extracted
information.

From the file `UnicodeData.txt` the following properties are set:
- `\catcode` 11 for all letters (Unicode class "L")
- `\catcode` 11 for all combining marks (Unicode class "M")
- `\sfcode` 999 for all code points of class "Lu" (upper case
  letters)
- `\lccode` for all of class "Ll" (upper case letters) to the code
  point itself, and `\uccode` to the upper case mapping (or if
  not given to the code point itself)
- `\uccode` for all of class "Lu" (upper case letters) to the code
  point itself, and `\lccode` to the lower case mapping (or if
  not given to the code point itself)
- `\lccode` and `\uccode` for all of class "Lt" (title case
  letters) to the lower can upper case mappings (or if not given
  to the code point itself)
- `\lccode` and `\uccode` for all other letter code points are
  set to the code point itself
- `\lccode` and/or `\uccode` for non-letter code points for
  which an upper or lower case mapping is given
- `\sfcode` 0 (ignored) for code points of Unicode classes "Pe"
  (closing punctuation marks) and "Pf" (final quotation marks)

From the file `MathClass.txt` the following mapping are
implemented between Unicode classes and TeX math types
- "L" (large)       `\mathop`
- "B" (binary)      `\mathbin`
- "V" (vary)        `\mathbin`
- "R" (relation)    `\mathrel`
- "O" (opening)     `\mathopen`
- "C" (closing)     `\mathclose`
- "P" (punctuation) `\mathpunct`
- "A" (alphabetic)  `\mathalpha`

For each code point processed, the result is of the form

    \Umathcode <codepoint> = <type> 1 <codepoint>

File: `load-unicode-xetex-classes.tex`
======================================

From the files `EastAsianWidth.txt` and `LineBreak.txt` inter
character classes for XeTeX (`\XeTeXcharclass`) are set for the
following classes
- "ID" (ideographic)
- "OP" (opener)
- "CL" (closer)
- "NS" (non-starter)
- "EX" (exclamation)
- "IS" (infix separator)
- "CM" (combining marks)

All code points of class "ID" are assigned to a
`\XeTeXcharclass`, but for other classes this only occurs when
they fall into east Asian width type "F", "H" or "W" (full-,
half- and wide-width).

The following mappings between Unicode and XeTeX classes occur
- "ID" is class 1
- "OP" is class 2
- "CL", "NS", "EX", "IS" are class 3
- "CM" is class 256 (ignored)

This file does _not_ activate XeTeX's inter-character token
mechanism (`\XeTeXinterchartokenstate` is not set) nor does it
install any material in the inter-character token registers.

Note that this file is separate from the main loader as the data
structure here may need more refinement at the macro level.

Data files
==========

The following data files are included here with permission of the
Unicode Consortium (see below):
- `UnicodeData.txt`
- `CaseFolding.txt`
- `EastAsianWidth.txt`
- `LineBreak.txt`
- `MathClass.txt`
- `SpecialCasing.txt`

With the exception of `MathClass.txt`, which is currently not
formally part of the Unicode Character Database, all of the
data files here are for Unicode 8.0.0.

Requests to include additional Unicode data files in this bundle are
welcome. Ideally this bundle will act as a single location for all
Unicode data for use by TeX systems.
