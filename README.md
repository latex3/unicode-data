The Unicode Consortium provide a range of data files detailing
the nature of code points in Unicode. These data files are
machine-readable but large. Here, a set of loaders are provided
to parse these files during a TeX run and set appropriate
parameters in an automated fashion.

File `load-unicode-casing.tex`
==============================

This file parses `UnicodeData.txt`, provided by the Unicode
Consortium, and when used with a Unicode-capable engine sets the
following TeX properties:
- `\catcode` 11 for all letters (Unicode class "L")
- `\catcode` 11 for all combining marks (Unicode class "M")
- `\sfcode` 999 for all code points of class Lu (upper case
  letters)
- `\lccode` for all of class Ll (upper case letters) to the code
  point itself, and `\uccode` to the upper case mapping (or if
  not given to the code point itself)
- `\uccode` for all of class Lu (upper case letters) to the code
  point itself, and `\lccode` to the lower case mapping (or if
  not given to the code point itself)
- `\lccode` and `\uccode` for all of class Lt (title case
  letters) to the lower can upper case mappings (or if not given
  to the code point itself)
- `\lccode` and `\uccode` for all other letter code points are
  set to the code point itself
- `\lccode` and/or `\uccode` for non-letter code points for
  which an upper or lower case mapping is given

File `load-unicode-classes.tex`
==========================

This file parses `EastAsianWidth.txt` and `LineBreak.txt`,
provided by the Unicode Consortium, and when used with XeTeX
sets `\XeTeXcharclass` for the following classes of code point:
- "ID" (ideographic) are class 1
- "OP" (opener) are class 2
- "CL" (closer), "NS" (non-starter), "EX" (exclamation) and "IS"
  (infix separator) are class 3
- "CM" (combining marks) are class 256 (transparent to the
  inter-character token register mechanism)

All code points of type "ID" are set to class 1, other code
points are only set where they fall into east Asian width type
"F", "H" or "W" (full-, half- and wide-width).

Issues and improvements
=======================

Any issues with the `.def` files should be addressed by updating
the generator script. The home page for this bundle is
https://github.com/latex3/unicode-data, and issues may be
reported there.
