% This file parses UnicodeData.txt, provided by the Unicode Consortium,
% and when used with a Unicode-capable engine sets the the \sfcode of
% code points of Unicode classes "Pe" (closing punctuation marks) and "Pf"
% (final quotation marks) to 0 (transparent to TeX).

% =============================================================================
%
% The data can only be loaded by Unicode engines. Currently this is limited to
% XeTeX and LuaTeX, both of which define \Umathcode (though that is not used in
% this file).
\ifx\Umathcode\undefined

\fi
% This file can be loaded in IniTeX mode so the category codes of |{|, |}| and
% |#| may not be correct. Everything is done in a group so that only the
% settings we want to propagate are made available generally.
