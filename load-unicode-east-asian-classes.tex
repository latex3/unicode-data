% This file parses EastAsianWidth.txt and LineBreak.txt, provided by the
% Unicode Consortium, and when used with XeTeX sets \XeTeXcharclass for
% the following classes of code point:
% - "ID" (ideographic)
% - "OP" (opener)
% - "CL" (closer)
% - "NS" (non-starter)
% - "EX" (exclamation)
% - "IS" (infix separator)
% - "CM" (combining marks)
%
% All code points of class "ID" are assigned to a \XeTeXcharclass, but for
% other classes this only occurs when they fall into east Asian width type
% "F", "H" or "W" (full-, half- and wide-width).
%
% As standard, the following mappings between Unicode and XeTeX classes occur
% - "ID" -> 1
% - "OP" -> 2
% - "CL", "NS", "EX", "IS" - > 3
% - "CM" -> 256 (ignored)
% This may be over-ridden by defining \XeTeXcharclass<name> as the numerical
% value to use. For example, to assign Unicode code points of class "ID" to
% \XeTeXcharclass five you would use \chardef\XeTeXcharclassID=5.
%
% This file does _not_ activate XeTeX's inter-character token mechanism
% (`\XeTeXinterchartokenstate` is not set) nor does it install any material in
% the inter-character token registers.
